Homework,"['I have to say today was one of the most fun QV classes that I\'ve been a part of, and that\'s saying a lot! Thanks to everyone for participating and presenting convincing arguments based on your national positions! Just a reminder, here\'s the homework that is due next week. We\'re moving into the case-writing stage of the class, so your homework this week is to identify three case ideas (regardless of whether you already know which one you want to go with). For each case idea, write an annotation consisting of one paragraph (three to four sentences) describing the case idea and one paragraph (three to four sentences) evaluating the case idea. Bring your annotated case ideas to class next week. Don\'t forget to add another three sources to the source pool. I like the growing mound of material that you can pull evidence from!']"
Bible,"['Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind.']"
